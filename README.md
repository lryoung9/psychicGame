# **Psychic Game**

The app randomly picks a letter. The user has 9 chances to guess what letter the app chose. The app displays what letters the user has already guessed and will warn the user of a duplicate guess. If the user guesses correctly, the app adds a win to the display, and, analogously, the app will add a lose to the display if the user cannot guess the correct letter.

## Getting Started

To begin, simply choose a letter from the keyboard as your first guess. Once the game ends, it will automatically reset and you can begin by guessing a letter from the keyboard again.
